# Weekly Assignment Instructions


### Overview

This assignment will provide an introduction to reading and writing files in Python!

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this assignment you should be able to read data from a file and write to a file in such a way that you can "append" new records to the file instead of "overwriting" (i.e. replacing) it!  

### Instructions
1. **Review the following materials**:

   - [W3Schools Python File Handling](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_file_handling.asp)

     Please read all of the topics under the "File Handling" header in W3Schools.  

3. **Complete the following tasks**:
   - assignment_1.py
  
     Please run this file to validate you have collected the "student_grades.csv" file in the repository.  This is NOT a real grades list and typically you should NEVER commit a file like this to GitHub.  As this is a demo repository for reading/writing files however I wanted to give you all a common file to read/write from!  As always please make sure this code runs and gives the expected output.

   - assignment_2.py
  
     This file SHOULD calculate the average grade for the class!  Please fix the bugs in this script so that it runs and displays the given output!

   - assignment_3.py
  
     Please complete the assigned code as instructed in this script! 
   
4. **Please commit your code to a public GitHub repository**
    - Once you have completed all three tasks in your code please commit your updated python code to a public repository in GitHub!
    - Once you have a public repository link submit that link to the week one assignment in Brightspace!
